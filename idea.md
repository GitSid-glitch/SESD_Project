# Smart Project Management System

## 1. Problem Statement

Teams often struggle to manage projects, assign responsibilities, track progress, and maintain accountability in a structured way. Many existing tools are either too complex or lack clarity in workflow management.

This project aims to build a backend-focused Smart Project Management System that enables teams to manage projects, tasks, and sprints efficiently using a clean software engineering architecture.

## 2. Objective

To design and implement a full-stack application with primary focus on backend architecture that:

- Supports project and task management
- Implements role-based access control
- Tracks sprint progress
- Maintains activity logs
- Demonstrates OOP principles
- Uses appropriate design patterns
- Follows layered architecture (Controller-Service-Repository)

---

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)
- Project CRUD operations
- Task CRUD operations
- Sprint management
- Task assignment
- Task status transitions
- Comment system
- Activity logging
- Notification system (basic implementation)
- Soft delete support
- Pagination and filtering

---

## 4. Key Features

- Multi-user system
- Many-to-many project membership
- Task lifecycle management
- Sprint progress tracking
- Notification mechanism
- Clean separation of concerns
- Use of design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Singleton)
- Layered backend architecture

## 5. Proposed Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js + Express  
Database: PostgreSQL  
ORM: Prisma / Sequelize  
Authentication: JWT  
Frontend: React (minimal UI for interaction)
